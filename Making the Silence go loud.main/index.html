                        <strong>Dear Kat,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to say this to you for quite some time now, but somehow I never had the right opportunity. So, I thought to put it down in words. I have admired you not just for the way you carry yourself, but also for the little things that make you who you are. It is something which I really like, whether in conversations or in quiet moments with you. Rarely, you may come across someone who makes the world feel a little lighter, and I believe it is exactly that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I won't make this complicated. What I want to say is that I like you. It's simple. Having known you really means everything to me, and I just can't help but be attracted to the kind of person you are. There is just something about you that lingers on even when nothing special is happening. And let it be known or not, those moments mean a lot to me too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't expect anything out of this letter, except that you tell me the truth. I just needed you to know how I felt because it won't feel right to keep it to myself for any longer. If you ever feel the same, I'd be honored for the opportunity to spend more time with you. However, whatever it is, I hope it brings at least a smile knowing you are, without a doubt, someone special.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Sincerely yours,</strong> <br>
